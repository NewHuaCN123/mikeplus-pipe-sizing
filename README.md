# mikeplus-pipe-sizing
Experimental pipe sizing script for MIKE+


## Introduction

The script pipesize.py//This script adjusts the pipe diameter in a MIKE+ SQLite-database according to the maximum discharge in a MIKE 1D result file (*.res1d), based on  the ??? formula. It is used to increase the diameter in a set of pipes until free flow conditions, or at least until the water level slope is equal to the bed slope.
